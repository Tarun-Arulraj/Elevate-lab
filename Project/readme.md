🔐 AES Secure File Storage System
📌 Description

AES Secure File Storage System is a Python-based application that encrypts and decrypts files using AES-256 encryption. It protects sensitive data from unauthorized access and verifies file integrity to detect tampering.

🛠 Tools Used

Python 3

cryptography (AES-GCM, PBKDF2)

hashlib

argparse

JSON

⚙️ Working

User provides a file and password

Password is converted into a 256-bit key using PBKDF2

File is encrypted using AES-256-GCM

Encrypted file (.enc) and metadata are generated

Decryption restores the original file

SHA-256 hash verifies integrity

▶️ Usage
pip install cryptography
python aes_secure_storage.py encrypt file.txt
python aes_secure_storage.py decrypt file.txt.enc
python aes_secure_storage.py verify file.txt.enc

✅ Features

Strong AES-256 encryption

Password-based key generation

Integrity & tamper detection

Simple CLI interface

Cross-platform support

📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates secure file encryption using modern cryptographic standards and highlights the importance of data confidentiality and integrity in cybersecurity.
